# Hybrid-AutomationFramework
## Description
This is a scalable Hybrid Automation Framework developed using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Maven. The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and uses a data-driven approach for flexibility and maintainability. The automation is performed on the OrangeHRM Demo Website, simulating real-world web testing scenarios.

### Features
1.Page Object Model for better structure and reusability
2.Data-driven testing using TestNG parameters
3.Utilities for common actions (e.g., screenshot capture)
4.Maven integration for dependency management
5.TestNG for parallel execution and reporting
6.Easy integration with CI/CD tools like Jenkins
7.Designed with future scalability in mind
